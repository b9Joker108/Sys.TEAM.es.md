# Sys.TEAM.es.md
A repository and catchment for showcasing community scripts inspired by 'A Scriptkiddie Scriptoria:...', for the edification and employ, of the (fabled): 'Scripting Scriptkiddie Scriptoria' a.k.a. project codename 'THE Sys.teAm.es Repository.MD'. 

The repository name is an archaic play on the 'Pluralism of 'Systemically' putting an 'A' in the *NIX shell-scripting 'Team', with a nominal and honorary 'Doctorate':

**Licensing and Release**

Please note, by including your script in this catchment and repository, you comply and release it under the nominated license. 

NOTE: This centralised Nushell GitHub community collective script repository, is a model for a collective community script repository on GitHub. I feel we may usefully co-opt and adopt this process and protocol for the A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria project, except make it a broad and inclusive script catchment, and not just nu-specific for example, and therefore shell-agnostic. For our project, I feel shell inclusivity, viewing them as a continuum and as language dialectical variations, where each *NIX or Unix-like shell, has their own strengths, weaknesses, specialisations and use-cases, and that they are more powerful together, in synergy, to realise a particular use-case instantiation, and view the toolset as combinatory according to project parameters, rather than as silos, for discrete use, separately and in isolation:

## Repository Aspiration

As an aspiration, I feel it would be execellent to house a co-ordinated repository script base or showcase, where a script tendered in one shell scripting dialect, is also met and checked, as well as qualified point-counterpoint, with a comparable scripting solution and execution, in all the other extant shell scripting dialects. Moreover, maybe activate and foreground the repository `wiki`, as a forum to discuss executions, code and annotations, in relation to each other. I tender this co-ordinated dialogue and showcase, would be profoundly useful and edifying, for its centralised (and easily `git clone` localised and/or easily `git` forkable amenity and facility) and as it is potentially, essily interrogable, democratically and easily accessible, and may showcase, and potentially benchmark, comparative and comparable solutions and executions.
