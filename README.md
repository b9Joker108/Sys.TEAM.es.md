NOTE: This centralised Nushell community collective script repository, is a model for a collective community script repository on GitHub. I feel we may usefully co-opt and adopt this process and protocol for the A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria project, except make it a broad and inclusive script catchment, and therefore shell-agnostic. For our project, I feel shell inclusivity, viewing them as a continuum and as language dialectical variations, where each of them has their own strengths, weaknesses, specialisations and use-cases, and that they are more powerful together, in synergy, than separately and in isolation:
