The repository name is an archaic play on the 'Pluralism of 'Systemically' putting an 'A' in the *NIX shell-scripting 'Team', with a nominal and honorary 'Doctorate':

NOTE: This centralised Nushell GitHub community collective script repository, is a model for a collective community script repository on GitHub. I feel we may usefully co-opt and adopt this process and protocol for the A Fable of the Scriptkiddie Scriptoria project, except make it a broad and inclusive script catchment, and not just nu-specific for example, and therefore shell-agnostic. For our project, I feel shell inclusivity, viewing them as a continuum and as language dialectical variations, where each *NIX or Unix-like shell, has their own strengths, weaknesses, specialisations and use-cases, and that they are more powerful together, in synergy, to realise a particular use-case instantiation, and view the toolset as combinatory according to project parameters, rather than as silos, for discrete use, separately and in isolation:

I feel it would be execellent to have a co-ordinated script base, where a script tendered in one shell scripting dialect, is also met and checked, as well as qualified point-coynterpoint, with a comparable scripting solution and execution, in all the other shell dialects. This co-ordinated dialogue and showcase, would be profoundly useful and edifying, for its localised and interrogable, comparative and comparable executions.
